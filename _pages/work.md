## Digital Strategy

Looking for someone who understands your business needs as well as the constantly-changing digital landscape?

I'm currently open to new clients for my digital strategy consulting.

Book a no-pressure initial call with me to discuss your needs and let's see if we make a good fit. [Drop me a line](https://davison.io/contact/).


## Projects

Some of the things I've launched

- **Smoothie Stacks**: Layered smoothie Instagram community.
- **EuroDiscover**: Europe travel community forum.
- **Craig's Minetest Server**: Started in 2013, went on to become one of the most popular and well-built servers for Minetest (an open source Minecraft-inspired game) with 100,000+ users who've joined over the years. I also made various game modifications to make the world experience better.

I've also had plenty of experience doing all sorts of digital, internet and technological work.
