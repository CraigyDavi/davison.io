<p class='lead'>Hi! I'm Craig.</p>

I'm a student studying business, maths and computing and living in Hampshire, UK.

I'm passionate about technology, business, the future and everything in between.

You'll probably find me drinking coffee, working on a crazy [side project]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) or learning something new.

I'm enthusiastic about change and generally love innovating and creating new ideas. My personality type is [ISFJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality).

On the internet you'll find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davisonio) and [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/add/davisonio) and [various other places]({{ site.baseurl }}/elsewhere/) and I'll answer any questions [emailed to me](mailto:craig@davison.io)!

So yeah, that's a brief version of me really. For serious stuff, I'm on [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/davisonio) & [AngelList](https://angel.co/davisonio) and can be contacted [over here]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/).

Thanks for stopping by and have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
