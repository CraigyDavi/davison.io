- Studying Business, Maths and Computing at [Farnborough Sixth Form College](http://www.farnborough.ac.uk).
- [Making positivity louder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ3oOMfizEk) and staying optimistic.
- Interests include business, technology, minimalism, travel and the future.
- Occasionally sharing my [stories](https://blog.davison.io), [code](http://code.davison.io) and [photography](https://ello.co/davisonio).

I'm open to opportunities to try something new. If you've got something interesting I'd love to [get in touch]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) with you!
