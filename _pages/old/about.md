<p class='largetype'>Hi! I'm Craig.</p>

<img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/my-profile-picture.png' alt='My Profile Picture' class='size-left' id='my-profile-picture'>

I'm a student studying business, maths and computing at [Farnborough Sixth Form College](https://farnborough.ac.uk) and I'm currently living in [Hampshire, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire).

I'm passionate about technology, business, economics, the future and everything in between.

I like sharing my [stories](https://medium.com/@davisonio), [code](https://github.com/davisonio), [photography](https://ello.co/davisonio) and my latest [side projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/).

I'm enthusiastic about change and generally love to learn something new or create new ideas. My personality type is [ISFJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality).

On the internet, you'll find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davisonio), [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/add/davisonio) and [various other places]({{ site.baseurl }}/elsewhere/). For serious stuff, I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davisonio) & [AngelList](https://angel.co/davisonio) and can be contacted [over here]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/).

I'm open to opportunities to try something new. If you've got something interesting I'd love to [get in touch]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) with you! Thanks for stopping by and have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
