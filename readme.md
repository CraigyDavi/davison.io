Here's the source code of my website which you can find at [davison.io](https://davison.io).

Blog is powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.org) using the Casper theme. Static pages are generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and are based on Casper.

Blog theme has a few changes from the default Casper theme, including:
* Font Awesome icons
* RSS link in footer
* No floating header
* No related posts
* Simplified post cards
* Simplified author attribution
* 280 character post card exerpt
* No large post cards
* No larger font on `p:first-child`.

## Install

Make sure ruby is installed (ideally using rvm) and then install Jekyll.

`gem install jekyll`

Install plugins:
```
gem install jekyll-sitemap
```

To use the blog theme, install in Ghost admin interface.

## Use

`jekyll build`

Then configure nginx to point to the `_site` generated directory.
